description: 'This is a Flask web idle game in the tradition of games like Cookie Clicker.  The user loads the web site and they are greeted with a login prompt for username and password, or the ability to make a new user.  After logging in or creating a new username and password, they are greeted with the main game screen where they can see see how much gold they have, how much experience they have, what items they have, and what their current stats are.  Every level they should be able to assign stat points as well, 1 per level.  The main game consists of them clicking the "adventure" button to go on an adventure over and over.  They gain both gold and experience when they do so.  Items and level change how much experience is gained per adventure in a linear progression way way. Every time they click adventure they have a chance of obtaining an item with the properties contained in an item generator python file.  These have different rarities and also scale based on level. I am using sqlite to store the player information'
